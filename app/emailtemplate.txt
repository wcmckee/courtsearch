Hello,

A new property has been listed by a Homeowner Who Helps on Domain.com.au. This means there are three days where this property available exclusively to applicants who are in need before it is published publicly on the domain site and available for all applicants.

If you know anyone who is looking for a house like this, please let them know.


We recommend tenants only apply if they are looking for a place to stay for a minimum of three months, and we request all applicants are currently free of any substance abuse addictions.

If you feel a future applicant may need support finding bond, please know that there are services available to support with this.

Most property listings are furnished already, and some allow pets, but please check each specific listing for criteria.

Have a lovely week,

The Homeowner Who Helps team.
